              American Communities Study ({MDAC})",
  author   = "Altekruse, Sean F and Cosgrove, Candace M and Altekruse, William

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Understanding relationships between individual-level
              demographic, socioeconomic status (SES) and U.S. opioid
              fatalities can inform interventions in response to this crisis.
              METHODS: The Mortality Disparities in American Community Study
              (MDAC) links nearly 4 million 2008 American Community Survey
              responses to the 2008-2015 National Death Index. Univariate and
              multivariable models were used to estimate opioid overdose
              fatality hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI).
              RESULTS: Opioid overdose was an overrepresented cause of death
              among people 10 to 59 years of age. In multivariable analysis,
              compared to Hispanics, Whites and American Indians/Alaska Natives
              had elevated risk (HR = 2.52, CI:2.21-2.88) and (HR = 1.88,
              CI:1.35-2.62), respectively. Compared to women, men were at-risk
              (HR = 1.61, CI:1.50-1.72). People who were disabled were at
              higher risk than those who were not (HR = 2.80, CI:2.59-3.03).
              Risk was higher among widowed than married (HR = 2.44,
              CI:2.03-2.95) and unemployed than employed individuals (HR =
              2.46, CI:2.17-2.79). Compared to adults with graduate degrees,
              those with high school only were at-risk (HR = 2.48,
              CI:2.00-3.06). Citizens were more likely than noncitizens to die
              from this cause (HR = 4.62, CI:3.48-6.14). Compared to people who
              owned homes with mortgages, those who rented had higher HRs (HR =
              1.36, CI:1.25-1.48). Non-rural residents had higher risk than
              rural residents (HR = 1.46, CI:1.34, 1.59). Compared to
              respective referent groups, people without health insurance (HR =
              1.30, CI:1.20-1.41) and people who were incarcerated were more
              likely to die from opioid overdoses (HR = 2.70, CI:1.91-3.81).
              Compared to people living in households at least five-times above
              the poverty line, people who lived in poverty were more likely to
              die from this cause (HR = 1.36, CI:1.20-1.54). Compared to people
              living in West North Central states, HRs were highest among those
              in South Atlantic (HR = 1.29, CI:1.11, 1.50) and Mountain states
              (HR = 1.58, CI:1.33, 1.88). DISCUSSION: Opioid fatality was
              associated with indicators of low SES. The findings may help to
              target prevention, treatment and rehabilitation efforts to
              vulnerable groups.",
